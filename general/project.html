<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
<p class="warning">This spec is subject to change as we go through the semester!</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. There's
no really great reason why we should all use facebook.com or
google+ or MySpace or something like that. If these social networks
came up with an API you could probably link between them and use
the social network you wanted. Furthermore, you might gain some
autonomy.</p>
<p>Thus, in the spirit of diaspora https://diasporafoundation.org/ 
(Diaspora was the predecessor to Mastodon)
we want to build something like diaspora but far, far simpler.</p>
<p>This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of
other sources of information (GitHub) as well allow the
distribution and sharing of posts and content.</p>
<p>An author sitting on one node can aggregate
the posts of authors they follow on other nodes.   </p>
<p>We are going to go with an inbox model where you share posts to
your followers by sending them your posts. This is similar to
activity pub: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/ ActivityPub
is the protocol that powers most distributed social media such
as Mastodon.
Activity Pub is great, but too complex for a class project.</p>
<p>We also won't be adding much in the way of encryption or security
to this platform. We're keeping it simple and restful.</p>
<p>Choose at least 4 other groups to work with!</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>I log into SocialDistribution. I see my stream which is filled with
posts that have arrived in my inbox combined with public posts that my node knows about.
I browse them and I click like on anything by my friend Steph who is on another node.</p>
<p>When I click like, my node sends a like object to Steph's inbox
that references her post.</p>
<p>I then comment on Steph's post. This sends a comment object to
Steph's inbox that references her post.</p>
<p>Steph's node will process events at her inbox and record the
comments and likes appropriately.</p>
<p>Then I write a public post, a public service announcement (PSA)
about how public service announcements are pretentious preformative
social media, and you shouldn't make them. The irony is lost on me.
I make an unlisted image post that contains an image for the PSA
and reference it from my PSA post. Nonetheless, my node records my
post and makes a URL for both posts and then proceeds to send my
public posts to the inboxes of everyone who follows me. My node
knows who follows me and thus can just send the public post to each
of those inboxes. Perhaps there will be a scaling problem in the
future.</p>
<p>Later I write a friends-only post about how much I hate the movie The Room (2003).
Tommy Wiseau can't see it because I'm not friends with Tommy Wiseau, but this post is sent to Steph's inbox, and she can see it because she's my friend.</p>
<p>When Steph logs into her node she'll see her stream and my public
post and my friends-only post will be on her stream.
She should also see that I've liked and commented her post.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-summary">Scenario Summary</h4>
<p>All actions from authors are routed through the inbox of the receiving authors by the node itself.</p>
<p>Nodes will store copies of posts because they receive them in the inbox.</p>
<p>Likes and comments on posts are all sent to the inbox of the author.</p>
<p>Public posts are sent to the inboxes of all followers of the author.</p>
<p>Friends-only posts are sent to the inboxes of all friends of the author.</p>
<p>Posts, likes, comments, posts, are all sent to the inboxes of the authors that should be able to see them.</p>
<h4 id="project-parts">Project Parts</h4>
<ul>
<li>Part 0: sign up a repo</li>
<li>Part 1: 1/2 way implementation</li>
<li>Part 2: Centralized implementation</li>
<li>Part 3: Connected implementation</li>
<li>Part 4: Connect with Groups</li>
<li>Part 5: Finish it off!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may consult with other teams. The submission must be your own team's source code.</li>
<li>You may work with 5 other students (groups of 6)</li>
<li>Work will be submitted together</li>
<li>Collaboration must be documented in the README.md file</li>
<li>Any external source code must be referenced and documented in the README.md file.</li>
<li>You make collaborate/consult with other groups in order to get your web services to integrate with each other</li>

<li>This is what a READER or USER of the social network has. They follow authors, and the authors they follow send objects to their inbox.</li>

<li>This forms the backbone of the timeline of the social media user.</li>
<li>This receives likes and comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stream<ul>
<li>The user interface showing date-sorted (most recent first) local, public posts combined with posts from everyone that user follows.</li>

<p>Notes on the above tables:
* This can work entirely on push from the author's server to another author's inbox.
* Yes, this means that only the local node (node where the post came from) will have a complete list of comments/likes. Mastodon/Diaspora also have this problem.
* "Unfollow" the API is missing this functionality.
* Yes, a node may have an out of date list of followers if a remote follower unfollows.
* "View Friends-Only" the API is missing this functionality. </p>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remote node authentication is global between nodes. It requires an admin to allow node to node access.</li>
<li>Remote node authentication is done solely with HTTP basic auth</li>
<li>Local auth uses your local auth mechanisms (cookies, tokens, basic auth).</li>
<li>Local auth is between an author's UI and an author's node server.<ul>
<li>It could be the web UI you make</li>
<li>It could also be another custom UI (like an android app)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Local refers the RESTful API for authors on that node.<ul>
<li>This is useful for frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular to get access to data, and enable a more client heavy UI.</li>
<li>Even if your frontend does not use them, endpoints marked [local] should be usable by a future Android/iOS client to achieve the same functionality as frontend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="pagination">Pagination</h4>
<p>If something is paginated it has query options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>page_number</code> - how many pages of objects have been delivered</li>
<li><code>size</code> - how big is a page</li>
<li>Page 4 of objects http://service/api/author/{AUTHOR_SERIAL}/posts/{POST_SERIAL}/comments?page=4</li>
<li>Page 4 of objects but 40 per page http://service/api/author/{AUTHOR_SERIAL}/posts/{POST_SERIAL}/comments?page=4&amp;size=40</li>
<li>1 based indexing. First page is 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Methods (PUT POST GET DELETE) not explicitly listed are not allowed methods<ul>
<li>Most HTTP methods are local API only, and provided for local node use.</li>
<li>Local node use means for use by the frontend to communicate with the backend it came from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are free to add your own endpoints for local node use, but you must document and test them.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-talks-to-who">Who talks to Who</h4>
<ul>
<li>Required: The backends talk to each other, mostly trough POST requests to the <code>inbox</code> URLs for remote authors.</li>
<li>Optional: The frontend talks to the backend for the same node.</li>
<li>Forbidden: The frontend talks to a backend of another node. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>Almost all node-to-node communication proceeds by the node where something (post/like/comment/follow request) was created POSTing that thing that was created to the relevant authors inbox on a remote node.</p>
<p>Node-to-node (marked as "[remote]") request other than "POST to inbox" are rarely needed, but you should support them in case the remote node needs to check something.</p>
<h4 id="example-node-to-node-api-view">Example (node-to-node API View)</h4>
<p>The Frontend-to-Backend (also known as [local]) communication for this scenario is up to your team, this only describes the Backend-to-Backend communication between two different nodes.</p>
<ol>
<li>I sign up for SocialDistribution on http://node1</li>
<li>node1 administrator approves my account.</li>
<li>Now an author object exists that represents me at http://node1/api/authors/555555555</li>
<li>I use the interface to make a follow request to Steph, who is node2/api/authors/777777777</li>
<li>My node POSTs the follow request to Steph's inbox at http://node2/api/authors/777777777/inbox</li>
<li>When Steph logs in, she sees my follow request and approves it.</li>
<li>Now Steph's node (node2) knows that I am following her.</li>
<li>Steph makes a public post.</li>
<li>Steph's node (node2) sends Steph's new post to my inbox with POST http://node1/api/authors/555555555/inbox.</li>
<li>I eventually see Steph's new post, and click like on it.</li>
<li>My node sends the like to Steph's inbox with POST http://node2/api/authors/777777777/inbox</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When sending a follow request to a foreign author, you (as the sending author/node) do not need to await any form of confirmation from the receiving author.</p>
<p>For example, suppose author A sends a follow request to author B. Once the follow request is sent from A to B's inbox, A's node can assume that A is following B, even before author B accepts or denies the request.</p>
<p>If B later denies author A's request, then B's posts will never be sent to A's inbox. But from the perspective of A's node the acceptance or rejection of a follow request is immaterial.</p>
<p><del></p>
<h4 id="example-how-sharing-public-posts-propagates-them-to-new-nodes">Example (How sharing public posts propagates them to new nodes.)</h4>
<p>Let's say we have author 1 on server A, author 2 on server B, and author 3 on server C. </p>
<p>If 2 follows 1 but no one on C follows 1, then C won't be aware of the public posts made by 1.</p>
<p>But if 3 follows 2, and 2 shares it, then the post will be sent to 3's inbox and C will become aware of it.
</del></p>
<h4 id="ids">IDs</h4>
<p>Posts may be generated a UUID, or ID#, or whatever for internal database/model use. However, on the API the post or author should always have a fully qualified URL as its ID, and you must always identify remote objects (authors, posts, likes, comments, ...) as their full URL, including the URL of the node they came from. This means you will need to look up authors and posts in your database by their full URL ID, even if they are local.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario: if two nodes both have an author with primary key 2, your node should never be able to be confused about which node's author the database is referring to, because all posts/likes/comments/follows from that author contain the author's full URL.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario #2: <code>http://node1/api/authors/0192019f-b832-74b2-b2c4-f7aadc972cb2</code> is Jane, and <code>http://node2/api/authors/0192019f-b832-74b2-b2c4-f7aadc972cb2</code> is John. Jane and John still need to be able to like/comment/follow/post with each other. That means, your database should not connect models using the field containing <code>0192019f-b832-74b2-b2c4-f7aadc972cb2</code>, but instead, the field containing <code>http://node1/api/authors/0192019f-b832-74b2-b2c4-f7aadc972cb2</code>.</p>
<p>Hint: In Django, set <code>unique=True</code> on the field. Then use <code>models.ForeignKey</code> with source and destination field names to relate the two models (join the two tables).</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement the webservice as described in the user stories</li>
<li>Provide a webservice interface that is restful</li>
<li>Provide a web UI interface that is usable</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 1 clone of your project. (Parts 3-5)</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 2 other groups. (Parts 4-5)</li>
<li>Show that you are making a serious effort to connect with at least 4 other groups. (Parts 4-5)</li>
<li>Prove your project by connecting with at least 3 other groups. (Part 5)</li>
<li>Make a video demo of your blog (desktop-recorder is ok) <ul>
<li>Your video may <strong>not</strong> be a part of your presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make a presentation about your blog </li>
<li>Follow the guidelines in the <a href="../general/project.html">project spec</a> for URLs and services</li>
<li>Allow users to accept or reject follow requests</li>
<li>Images get the same protection that posts get as they are POSTS</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="#api-requirements">API requirements</a> in the following section</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="#infrastructure-and-software-requirements">Infrastructure and Software Requirements</a> in the following section</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="api-requirements">API Requirements</h4>
<p>When building your API, try to adhere to these rules for easy compatibility with other groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST API calls may be prefixed like: <code>http://service_address/api/authors/{AUTHOR_SERIAL}/posts/</code></li>
<li>Document your service address, port, hostname, prefix (if used), and the username/password for HTTP Basic Auth in your README so that HTTP clients can connect to your API.</li>
<li>You <strong>must</strong> be compatible with the API specification and examples listed above in this document. <ul>
<li>You <strong>may</strong> need to add some additional things for compatibility with other groups due to varying interpretations.</li>
<li>You <strong>may</strong> add additional endpoints and JSON keys as long as you provide the ones listed above.</li>
<li>If you follow something close to, but not compatible with the API specification in this document, then you will get something close to, but not exactly, a good grade.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="test-requirements">Test Requirements</h4>
<p>The REST API must be fully tested.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every API endpoint must be tested.</li>
<li>Every API functionality must be tested.</li>
<li>Every API method must be tested.</li>
<li>Every user story must be tested at the API level.</li>
<li>If a user story does not have an API, it must be tested by calling the Django code directly.</li>
<li>Tests that don't actually test what they say they're testing do not count.</li>
</ul>
<p>These would be system/acceptance tests if the project didn't have a frontend.</p>
<p>Testing the user stories at the API level should give you the tests you need for every API endpoint, every API functionality, and every API method.
<strong>Pretend you are writing tests to make sure a future Android client will work with your API.</strong></p>
<p>Not every user story has an API to test. For example, adding/removing nodes to connect with usually does not have an API. For these functions, please test them in whatever way is most convenient for your project, and then verify them using the API. You could write a test that adds a node to connect with by calling Python code or modifying the database directly, then use the API to check that the new node connection is working.</p>
<p>Frontend (Selenium, etc.) tests are not required. Code coverage (line coverage, statement coverage, branch coverage, MC/DC, etc.) is not required. Unit testing is not required.</p>
<h4 id="documentation-requirements">Documentation Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every API endpoint is documented.<ul>
<li>When the API endpoint should be used</li>
<li>How the API endpoint should be used</li>
<li>Why the API endpoint should or should not be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every API endpoint has multiple examples.</li>
<li>Every JSON field in both request and response<ul>
<li>Has a type </li>
<li>Has an example value</li>
<li>Has an explanation of its purpose (when to use it)</li>
<li>For the request</li>
<li>For the response</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explanation of anything interesting about each endpoint<ul>
<li>Whether it is paginated, ...<ul>
<li>How to use the pagination, ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are using some automated documentation generation, you must augment that documentation with examples, types, explanations, when, what, how, why, why not...</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="code-requirements">Code Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Code is well organized and has good style<ul>

<li>Good indentation</li>
<li>Well organized</li>
<li>It should be very easy for a TA or instructor to find the all the code responsible for a user story</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tool-use-requirements">Tool Use Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>All teammates are using Git and GitHub<ul>
<li>Evidence of teammates using Git and GitHub to work together should be obvious</li>
<li>Working on code at the same time</li>

<h4 id="infrastructure-and-software-requirements">Infrastructure and Software Requirements</h4>
<aside class="longWarning">
<p><strong>Failure to meet these requirements will result in a score of zero for project parts.</strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you make your frontend using HTML, CSS, JS. You can use Jinja templates (it comes with Django) or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components">WebComponents</a>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>We will not be covering frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, Solid, Svelte... (there are dozens of these) in lecture or in lab, for a number of reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>We don't have time to cover this during the semester. It would require a second semester to cover these.<ul>
                <li>You will have to learn how to work with these frameworks yourself.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>React is losing popularity.<ul>
                <li>In ten years, knowing React will not be valuable anymore, because everyone will redo their websites in something else. This already happened with jQuery. 10 years ago all the 404 students wanted to learn jQuery, and now people barely use it.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>There is no standard frontend framework other than plain HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>The fact that large businesses like Facebook, Google, and Walmart use them does not mean they are good for a small semester project with a small team.</li>
            <li>All of the React-style (reactive paradigm) frameworks have major flaws that cannot be fixed, because the paradigm itself is flawed.</li>
            <li>All of the React-style (reactive paradigm) frameworks and most of the other frameworks are much more difficult to debug than plain JS or JS with a few libraries. This is because they make it difficult or impossible to determine why a component is being rerendered. They make it difficult or impossible to trace the code backwards from an error to the source of the problem.</li>
            <li>All of the component-based frameworks produce really bad HTML for the browser that is also difficult to debug or understand how it was produced.</li>
            <li>All frameworks using a shadow DOM are difficult to debug because the DOM updates are applied all at once, instead of step-by-step.</li>
            <li>All of the important contributions of React (components, shadow DOM, scoped CSS) have already been added to native HTML/CSS/JS, removing the need for React.<ul>
                <li>Once again, this already happened with jQuery. All the good parts of jQuery got added to native JS, and now people barely use it.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>A strong knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS allows you to quickly learn any framework, while knowing one framework does not teach you much about HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
            <li>It's very easy to make your own React-style frontend framework. There is nothing special about React. React's popularity comes from the fact that Facebook made it. Angular is popular because Google made it.</li>
            <li>Any particular frontend framework may not be able to meet the project requirements.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>TAs will not help you with frontend frameworks.</li>
    <li>Every semester there are at least a few students who choose to use a frontend framework and then, as a result:<ul>
        <li>End up having to redo large amounts of work when the framework turns out to not meet the requirements of the project</li> 
        <li>End up not being able to get parts of their application working due to the complexity and difficulty of debugging the framework code</li>
        <li>End up with a web app that is incredibly slow</li>
        <li>End up needing custom API endpoints which aren't specified above, so they have to do extra work</li>
        <li>End up fighting among themselves because only one teammember can understand the framework</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to use React or a similar frontend framework such as Angular, Vue, Solid, Svelte... (there are dozens of these), despite these warnings, then all team members must fill out the frontend framework form. We offer this option only becuase some students want the experience for their resumé. However, it involves extra work. If <strong style="color: darkred;">all team members</strong> do not fill out the frontend framework form agreeing to use a front end framework despite the extra work required and the above warnings then you are not allowed to use a frontend frameworks, and using them will result in a mark of zero.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Backend frameworks are limited to Django and Flask only. We suggest Django. Flask requires extra work.</li>
    <li>Server-side rendering is limited to Jinja templates (provided by Django), or another templating engine that can run in Django/Flask.</li>
    <li>Combined frontend-backend frameworks, and server-side component rendering is not allowed unless you can get it working in Django on Heroku.<ul>
        <li>Server side rendering requiring a node server is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Anything requiring a node server is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Next.js, ... and similar server-side frameworks are not allowed. The only allowed server-side frameworks are Django and Flask.</li>

<h3 id="teamwork-tips">Teamwork Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>These optional. They are just advice. They usually lead to less conflict and a better end result.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most successful teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use pull requests.<ul>
<li>Pull requests are great in general, but they tend to cause problems because the project is very small and groups are also small.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use very, very few branches (e.g. production and staging).<ul>
<li>Do not use author branches (or branches where a single author is the only one touching them).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commit, pull, push the code they're working on, to the same branch that everyone else is working on, at least once an hour.<ul>
<li>Commit code that doesn't break the overall project.</li>
<li>Avoid your version being broken for more than an hour.</li>
<li>Do not stay up all night, change everything, and push a hundred changes all over the code base as one giant pull request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Divide teamwork by user story, instead of frontend vs backend.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submission will be by GitHub Classroom. Please follow the link on eClass. Make sure you also submit a link on eClass on time!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marking">Marking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usually all teammates will share the same mark.</li>
<li>An individual student's marks will be reduced if the instructor (or a TA in consultation with the instructor) finds that:<ul>
<li>The student is not contributing or contributing significantly less than their teammates.</li>
<li>The individual student is significantly preventing their teammates from participating or contributing.</li>
<li>The individual student's is significantly misusing git/GitHub/Heroku/other software tools.</li>
<li>The individual student is engaging in significant "intellectual violence."<ul>
<li>Intellectual violence is when one teammate uses their skill, knowledge, or experience, to intimidate or control the other teammate(s) rather than sharing and helping them learn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The individual student is not communicating or only communicating very rarely with their team.</li>
<li>The individual student does not complete the peer feedback form (-1 mark for each part 1-4).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any concerns about teamwork must be brought to the instructor's (not the TA) attention <em>by email</em> well before the last lab.<ul>
<li>It takes time to investigate these things. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="overall-marking">Overall Marking</h4>

<li>Node is at least partially working with nodes from 4 other teams.</li>
<li>Node must be fully communicating and working with nodes from 2 other teams.<ul>
<li>These count toward the 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All nodes must be able coordinating. All user stories involving multiple authors must work in both situations:<ul>
<li>All authors on the same node</li>
<li>Authors on different nodes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example if the user story is "As an author, I want to be able to approve or deny other authors following me, so that I don't get followed by people I don't like."<ul>
<li>This needs to work when the author following is on a different node from the author they are following.</li>
<li>It also needs to work if they're on the same node.</li>

<h5 id="presentation">Presentation</h5>
<p>Your presentation will be 5 minutes max. Then you will have a minute or two for questions.</p>
<p>Your presentation should focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Important functions<ul>
<li>You won't have time for every function in 5 minutes, so make sure to cover the most important functions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your UI<ul>
<li>This is what makes your project different from the other teams, so be sure to show it off!</li>
<li>We don't really need to see the Django admin panel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Federation<ul>
<li>Walk through your working connection with other team(s).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Guide for a good presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, everyone in your team should take turns speaking.<ul>
<li>However, I do understand that some people have public speaking anxiety, so you won't be penalized if someone doesn't speak.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ideally, your presentation will use your live web app.<ul>
<li>The most successful teams in the past use note cards.</li>
<li>Prepare backup slides in case something goes wrong that prevents you from doing a live demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best presentations tell a story, walking through a typical user scenario.<ul>
<li>An example of such a scenario is the one in the "Scenario" section above. But don't use that one, come up with your own that shows
off your app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rehearse your presentation in person as a team to make sure it is close to 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Make sure your team has a laptop that works with the projector <em>before</em> the presentation day.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the other team's presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rudeness to the other teams will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>Your team must arrive on time. Late teams will not be allowed to present.</li>
<li>You and your team must stay for all presentations and show respect, support, and appreciation for the other teams hard work.</li>
<li>You may ask thoughtful questions after each presentation.</li>
<li>Wait until after questions to applaud. Otherwise, everyone ends up awkwardly applauding each team twice.</li>

<li>Tool use: Limited of tool use. Only one teammate seems to be working at a time. Git is disorganized.</li>
<li>TA Walkthrough: Many snags, bugs, last second workarounds, small missing pieces.</li>
<li>Web Service API Documentation: Low on details. Many things are unclear. Every endpoint is documented. Missing some example requests and responses. If using automated documentation generation, there is extra documentation added on top of that.</li>
<li>Standards &amp; Code Style: Browser, Python, transpiler, bundler, etc. warnings. Code is poorly organized God files/classes/functions. Have to search or grep code to find the code responsible for something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attempt<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong>: Lack of practice, lack of preparation, irrelevant, many snags, includes video.</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: A video of the app exists.</li>
<li>Web Service Coordination: Coordination with another team's node barely works. Less than half interoperation requirements met. Showstopper problems. Some user stories work node-to-node.</li>
<li>Inter-Team Coordination: Evidence of progress working with <strong>two</strong> other teams nodes. (Three includes the one team above.)</li>
<li>Addressing Feedback: Some of TA's suggestions were implemented, TA approves of some of the changes made to address feedback.</li>
<li>User Stories UI: Less than half of the user stories are usable using the UI or major deviations from the user stories.</li>
<li>User Stories API: Less than half of the user stories are usable using the API or major deviations from the specification.</li>
<li>Test Cases: Less than half of the user stories are usable using the API or major deviations from the specification, or test cases are present but do not actually test what they say they are testing.</li>
<li>UI Design: Some pieces of the HTML &amp; CSS exist, but some pieces of the HTML &amp; CSS are missing that would be needed to do some of the user stories.</li>
<li>Tool use: Very limited of tool use. Git is disorganized. Git exists but it has built artifacts in it. Git has commits that do not contribute anything, but have large diffs, such as changing whitespace of every line in a file.<!-- @LT-IGNORE:ENGLISH_WORD_REPEAT_BEGINNING_RULE@ --></li>
<li>TA Walkthrough: Showstopper bugs. Major missing pieces.</li>
<li>Web Service API Documentation: Major pieces of documentation are missing or only has autogenerated documentation. </li>
<li>Standards &amp; Code Style: HTML errors, browser errors, CSS errors, JS errors, Python errors. Code is disorganized. Code is hard to find. Code is missing. <!-- @LT-IGNORE:ENGLISH_WORD_REPEAT_BEGINNING_RULE@ --></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No attempt<ul>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong>: No presentation.</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong>: No video of the app exists.</li>
<li>Web Service Coordination: No user stories are coordinating with another team's node.</li>
<li>Addressing Feedback: None of TA's suggestions were implemented, TA approves of none of the changes made to address feedback.</li>
<li>Inter-Team Coordination: No attempt to work with another team.</li>
<li>User Stories UI: No user stories are usable using the UI.</li>
<li>User Stories API: No user stories are usable using the API.</li>
<li>Test Cases: No test cases are present.</li>
<li>UI Design: No HTML/CSS exists.</li>
<li>Tool use: Used file sharing, email attachments, sending files/code through discord, chat, messengers, or similar tools to work together. Git exists but it not being used, or it is being misused.</li>
<li>TA Walkthrough: No walkthrough. Unable to demo. </li>
<li>Web Service API Documentation: Documentation is missing or unable to find documentation. </li>
<li>Standards &amp; Code Style: Project doesn't run/load.</li>
